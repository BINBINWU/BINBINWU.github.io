Introduction to Data Mining Final Project - Analysis of education, religion, political data

This project focused on conducting correlation analysis to determine the relationship between adherents population, educated population and different political view population. More importantly, the project is aimed to help people to understand whether the change of adherents population and educated population is related to the political view shifts. 

A total of 9 datasets were collected in order to do the analysis. 
The datasets are from various data sources such as U.S. Census Bureau, National Center for Education Statistics, U.S. Religion Census 1952 to 2010 and Pew Research Center U.S. Politics & Policy. 

1)The data from U.S. Census Bureau showed the population by age and education level from 2007 to 2016. 
2)The data from National Center for Education Statistics presented population in the different field of studies and population by gender and education level from 1965 to 1990. 
3)The data from U.S. Religion Census 1952 to 2010 exhibited the adherent population and total population from 1971 to 2010. 
4)The data from Pew Research Center U.S. Politics & Policy revealed the population percentage of different political view by religion, education, gender, age and race in 2014.
